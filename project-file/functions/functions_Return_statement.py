'''
Defining a function and giving it a return statement is usefull when the function being defined has a lot of lines of code and we want to store the function in a variable before using it so as to use the variable later in the program.
By default all the functions in python returns NONE
 if a return stattement is not given the code will not work as planned, though print() can be used to view the value in the terminal.
